# AI-Quoridor
artificial intelligence final project for spring 99 course (prof: Dr. Armin Salimi-Badr)
in this project we tried to implement the quoridor board game, the intention was to create an AI agent which has the ability to compete against human opponenet.
in the first phase of the project we created an ai agent that works based on MINIMAX algorithm and uses a heuristic function with arbitrary coefficients in the final phase
using GENETIC algorithm we trained the agent to achieve the best values of hueristic function and be able to better compete or even beat the human player. the accuracy and strength of the agent depends on the MINIMAX tree depth and number of generations and initial population size of the genetic algorithm
